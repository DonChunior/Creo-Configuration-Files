# Creo Configuration Files

This project provides [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) [UDL files](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/User_Defined_Languages) for several configuration files of [PTC](https://www.ptc.com/)'s CAD system [Creo Parametric](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/cad/creo/parametric) (formerly known as Pro/ENGINEER).

The benefit of using the UDL files is that you get [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) when editing the configuration files with Notepad++.

## Installing

How to install a UDL file in Notepad++:
1. If Notepad++ is open, select "Define your language" from the "Language" menu.
2. Click on the "Import" button in the dialog window "User-Defined".
3. Select the corresponding UDL file (*.xml) in the selection dialog and click on the button "Open".
4. Confirm the message box "Import successful" by clicking on the button "OK".
5. Follow the steps 2 to 4 to install more UDL files.
6. Close the dialog window "User-Defined" by clicking on the "X" at the top right corner.
